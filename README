note
    Hash Table might return older value of key or value of key in prev
    version of db.
    eventual consistency property***

1. the key pointer is protected.
2. the value pointer is protected.
3. it is confirmed that the value is associated with the key.

Race Condition
     it is possible that another thread deletes and/or swaps
    the entries in the slot. So the value returned for the key might no longer
    be in the dictionary. This improves performance as it prunes the edge case
    of having a key value pair swapped at the last possible moment.

note
    slot : kA vA F
    set(kA, vB)
    slot : φ φ D
    slot : φ vB D

is a potential race condition in my code.
if *ptr_kA == kA during set then we place vb in CPVi
If another thread deletes kA & vA before the placement
Then we have a deleted slot with a ghost value
ghost values are cleaned up when a deleted slot is accessed
when probing with get()
